# Term Deposit Predictive Model

## About 

A supervised machine learnning predictive model to classify customers who are most likely to purchase a bank's term sheet. 

## Business Need

> I successfully finished up to my rigorous job interview process with Bank of Portugal
as a machine learning researcher. The investment and portfolio department would want
to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term
deposits. As there has been heightened interest of marketing managers to carefully tune
their directed campaigns to the rigorous selection of contacts, the goal of my employer
is to find a model that can predict which future clients who would subscribe to their term
deposit. Having such an effective predictive model can help increase their campaign
efficiency as they would be able to identify customers who would subscribe to their term
deposit and thereby direct their marketing efforts to them. 

> This would help them better manage their resources (e.g human effort, phone calls, time)
The Bank of Portugal, therefore, collected a huge amount of data that includes
customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who
did not subscribe to a term deposit. As their newly employed machine learning
researcher, they want me to come up with a robust predictive model that would help
them identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the
future.

> My main goal as a machine learning researcher is to carry out data exploration, data
cleaning, feature extraction, and developing robust machine learning algorithms that
would aid them in the department.
